# IV1201 Architecture and Design of Global Applications
## Project: Recruitment Application

This is the front-end part of a recruitment application developed for the course IV1201 at KTH. 
The application is developed using React, Vite, TypeScript and Material UI components, among other technologies. The application is a part of a larger system that includes a back-end and a database. 
The application is used by applicants to apply for jobs and by recruiters to manage job applications.

### Local development
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser

### Deployment
Pushes to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment to Vercel. 
All pushes to the `main` branch must be done through a pull request and should be reviewed by at least one other team member.
The application is deployed to [https://iv1201-frontend.vercel.app/](https://iv1201-frontend.vercel.app/)
